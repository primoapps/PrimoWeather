### If it really rained cats and dogs, there would be poodles all over the streets

I drought the above would ever happen, but if it did, you better be prepared. Same thing for when all the tornadoes get togther on the sunniest day of the week (Sunday, of course) and play a nice game of twister. Although, I hear only two tornadoes have been meeting up to play because three's a cloud.
